  The volume, variety and velocity of data are increasing rapidly.  Organizations need fast and easy-to-use tools to harness data for actionable insight. One of the biggest challenges facing organizations today is the requirement to provide a consistent, single version of the truth across all sources of information in an analytics-ready format.

  With powerful data extract, transform and load (ETL) capabilities, an intuitive and rich graphical design environment, and an open and standards-based architecture, Pentaho Data Integration is increasingly the choice over proprietary and homegrown data integration tools.
