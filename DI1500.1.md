  Metadata injection refers to the dynamic passing of metadata to PDI transformations at run time in order to control complex data integration logic. 
  The metadata (from the data source, a user defined file, or an end user request) can be injected on the fly into a transformation template, providing the “instructions” to generate actual transformations.
